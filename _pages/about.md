I am a final-year M.Phil. student in Computer Science and Engineering at [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/chinese/index.html) advised by Prof. [Qi Dou](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~qdou/index.html).
Before joining CUHK, I obtained my B.Eng. degree from the School of Information Science and Technology at [ShanghaiTech University](https://www.shanghaitech.edu.cn/). Currently, I am working with Prof. [Huazhe Xu](http://hxu.rocks/). 

My research aims to build intelligent machines through reinforcement learning (for achieving higher sampler efficiency) and robot learning (for improving long-horizon reasoning ability) from their experiences and offline data in the physical world. Outside of academics, I am an enthusiast of street photography ([tour my gallery](gallery)).
