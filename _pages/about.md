I am a final-year M.Phil. student in Computer Science and Engineering at [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/chinese/index.html) advised by [Qi Dou](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~qdou/index.html).
Before joining CUHK, I obtained my B.Eng. degree at [ShanghaiTech](https://www.shanghaitech.edu.cn/) as Outstanding Graduate in Shanghai. I have spent a wonderful summer in [Tencent Robotics X](https://ai.tencent.com/ailab/zh/index). Currently, I am working with [Huazhe Xu](http://hxu.rocks/) at [Shanghai Qi Zhi Institute](https://sqz.ac.cn/) and [Jiangmiao Pang](https://oceanpang.github.io/) at [Shanghai AI Laboratory](https://www.shlab.org.cn/).  

My research aims to build intelligent machines through reinforcement learning (for achieving higher sampler efficiency) and robot learning (for improving long-horizon reasoning ability) from their experiences and offline data in the physical world. Outside of academics, I am an enthusiast of street photography ([tour my gallery](gallery)).
