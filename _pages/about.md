I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science and Engineering at [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/chinese/index.html) advised by [Professor Qi Dou](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~qdou/index.html).
Before joining CUHK, I obtained my B.Eng. degree from the School of Information Science and Technology at [ShanghaiTech University](https://www.shanghaitech.edu.cn/).


My research aims to build intelligent machines through reinforcement learning (for achieving higher sampler efficiency) and robot learning (for improving long-horizon reasoning ability) from their experiences or offline data in the physical world.

Now, I am looking for intern opportunities and academic collaborations on the above topics.
